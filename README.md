# Short description

App with information and resources about plastic and household recycling.

# Project Description (Long)

Environmental pollution like land pollution, air pollution, and water pollution, are some of the major issues the world faces currently. About 2.9 years of life expectancy is lost due to air pollution, which is surprisingly greater than the life expectancy decreased by smoking tobacco (2.2 years). One of the reasons for air pollution is burning plastics, because burning plastics releasing harmful gases like black carbon into the air. This not only pollutes our air, but also contributes to global warming. Single-use plastics are one of the biggest contributors of plastic pollution that usually ends up as litter, in places with poor waste collection system. Recycling and reusing plastics are a great way of decreasing environmental pollution, but many people are not aware that not all plastics can be recycled! And plastic recycling is also dependent on set recycling programs which differ depending on cities and even districts and boroughs. Often the plastics that cannot be recycled end up in landfill, creating waste and using up space because plastics are non-biodegradable, meaning that they will never lose their shape and are not capable of being broken down in the soil. 

We have created a desktop app using C++, and QT framework that gives users important information about the types of plastics that can be recycled, and the types of plastics that cannot be recycled in New York city. We want to share this important knowledge with our users who care about proper recycling and reusing plastics and other products, so that we can make a difference in our communities by reducing our contribution to plastic and environmental pollution through making conscious decisions when buying plastic products. Plastic recycling locations in NYC are also provided in the app, and users can search the locations by each borough. There is also an informational sectional which is meant to give users inspiration for recycling by showing how plastic recycling can help make more plastic items without having to create more plastic. We have also integrated an IBM Watson assistant chatbot where users can chat with the bot to find out if specific household items are recyclable or not. Drop off locations for electronics, and textiles in NYC are also integrated, so users would easily be able to find out the nearest locations to recycle their items. These drop off locations are mapped from open datasets taken from NYC Open data platform and are an excellent resource for people who would like to recycle consciously.
